# Spend Checker App

SpendChecker app will monitor a user's day-to-day expenditures in a month. The users can categorize their spending list
and keep a track of where their money is going. They can also set spending goals and the application will automatically alert
them if they go over the limit. The users will get a breakdown of all of their expenditures and there is also a "what-if"
feature where the user will get a chance to see what their savings will look like if they didn't spend on certain things or any
unwanted things.

This applicaiton is suitable for students who often has to live with a tight budget. They can quickly monitor the areas where thier
money is going and how it is spent. This application will also promote healthy spending habits by encouraging a user to remain
within a budget if possible.

This project is interesting to me because as a student I know how hard it is to live with a tight budget. I sometimes overspend by eating
food outside and sometimes had to face money problems in some months because of this habit. That's why I have decided to make an expenditure tracking app.
I will get to learn how to make an app and along the process I might also get rid of an unwanted habit.
